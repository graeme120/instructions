      The world supposedly began with a sound. A bang! In contemporary culture,
      it is not a figure or image we associate with the origins of life, but
      merely a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sound is a tool far older than mankind, one that has been with us since
      our inception. It will forever be a mystery why and how music emerged from
      sound, but its origins are undoubtedly linked to the evolution of
      human-made tools and spoken language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Music notation is wildly predated by music itself, and just like language,
      was passed on purely through oral tradition. Moreover, the emergence of
      musical notation denotes the threshold between the prehistory and history
      of music.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Ancient Greece, it was Pythagoras who first discovered a proportional
      relationship between music notes. Two notes which make an interval of an
      octave always have a ratio of 2:1. A perfect fifth is made with the ratio
      of 3:2, and a perfect 4th with a ratio of 4:3. Combinations of these
      intervals then create the other notes which make up the major scale.

    <p>
      The ancient Greeks forever changed music by imposing a rational order onto
      it. Suddenly sound could be ‘notes’, if produced a certain way. Music, an
      outpouring of human emotion, had found a container, a rational form to
      give it structure. Nevertheless, it would be a few centuries more before
      this new language became a visual one.
    </p>
    <h2>Evolution of the Tool</h2>
    <p>
      The earliest version of today’s standard musical notation came from the
      European monasteries, and was used as a mnemonic device for the recitation
      of Gregorian chants. Their system used neumes, inflection marks that
      indicate the relative pitch compared to other neumes. As it did not
      indicate rhythm or exact pitch, these marks were designed for monks
      already familiar with the chant, and did not lend itself to the creation
      of new music.
    </p>

    <p>
      Somewhere at the turn of 1000 AD, Guido D’Arezzo, a Benedictine monk in
      Italy, popularized the use of staff notation, using a red line to indicate
      the position of the note f and a yellow line for the note c, working in a
      similar way to our modern base and treble clefs. He taught the use of
      solmization syllables based on a hymn to Saint John the Baptist:
    </p>

      />
      <div class="caption">
        Ut was later changed to the clearer syllable ‘Do’, as in dominus.
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Guido’s notational system had some important differences from the one in
      use today. Most notably, his system didn’t communicate the duration for
      which a note should be held, which massively influenced Fthe of the time;
      giving it a legato (smooth and connected) sound, since each note’s
      duration was up to the singer to interpret.
    </p>

    <p>
      Religious institutions would continue to act as the cultural outlet for
      music production for the next few hundred years.,he church was the largest
      producer of notated music. Spatially, its existence was limited to the
      walls of the church, where the acoustics provided by its high ceilings
      further amplified the music’s spiritual power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following centuries saw gradual modifications and expansions of the
      system used by the church. In the 14th century, Philippe de Vitry
      developed mensural notation, which communicated both pitch and rhythm
      using notes of different shapes.
    </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Mensural notation is its modern name, derived from the terminology of
      medieval theorists who described it as musica mensura (measured music), as
      opposed to musica plana, referring to Gregorian Chant. Up until this
      point, notated music and oral tradition had coexisted, as oral tradition
      supplemented information that notation could not contain. Now that pitch
      and rhythm could be communicated visually, the use of musical notation
      rose in prominence, and over time musica plana remained only within the
      church
    </p>

    <p>
      The renaissance period saw a number of these improvements and revisions to
      the notational standard. As compositions become more complex in terms of
      key and rhythm, the four-time-signature system introduced by de Vitry is
      abandoned in favor of our modern ‘fractional-style’ system.
    </p>
    <h2>Widespread Adoption & Refinement</h2>

    </div>
    <p>
      The Renaissance period, thanks to crucial technological advancements like
      the invention of the printing press, saw notated music spread across
      Europe. As instruments continued to expand in terms of sound making
      capability, more non-vocal music rose in popularity. Notations flexibility
      across all instruments became a uniting force, allowing orchestras to form
      and play under a shared language. Through mere marks and lines, sound
      could now organize itself into mankind’s most powerful expressions of pure
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now divorced from the church, typically in service of wealthy aristocrats,
      and with an orchestra of sounds at their disposal, composers became
      celebrity figures and were celebrated for their artistic genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is here where we see the true emergence of musical style, wherein
      composers became known for their specific sound and compositional
      technique. By this point, notation as a tool was refined, and offered
      composers both the structure and freedom to translate human emotion into
      breathtaking works of music.

    </div>
    <p>
      More than a tool, notation is a language of its own, allowing it to
      transcend speech and translation. Compared to the physicality of painting
      or sculpture, notation as a set of instructions enabled it to move farther
      and faster, inviting all of Europe to participate and contribute to a
      shared cultural experience. Composers, masters of this international
      language, learn from one another and in turn push orchestral music to new
      stylistic heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transition from Baroque to classical music in the 18th century
      inflected a certain energy into composition that notation struggled to
      keep up with, leading to the introduction of staccatos, slurs and a more
      expressive use of dynamics. As composers pushed against the limits of
      their tool, the tool itself was evolved to service their artistic demands.

      Classical music eventually gives way to the Romantic period, compositional
      music grows ever more popular, and the limitations of musical notation are
      pushed ever further. As time goes on, musical notation begins to
      standardize; the number of clefs used is reduced to the three still used
      in modern scores- G (treble), F (bass) and C (alto/tenor).

      The 20th century, as was the case with almost all artistic tradition, saw
      a radical break with tradition and the artistic continuum that defined
      previous centuries. This by no means was the end of notation, in fact
      notation had reached such ubiquity that massive modifications to the
      tool’s standard form would be enormously confusing and expensive.
      Textbooks, curriculums, thousands of pages of sheet music would need
      revision, not to mention the millions of musicians who would need to
      re-learn sight reading. No, standard notation could no longer evolve in
      the way it had in the past. Nevertheless, the modern era would find new
      ways to continue pushing the limits of notation.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the 20th century brought were demonstrations of alternative forms of
      musical notation. These iterations of the tool no longer strived to
      represent the ideas of the composer with accuracy, but instead subvert
      viewer’s expectations of a musical performance.

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      John Cage was an American composer and music theorist, born in 1912. One
      of his most seminal works was 4’33, a composition that featured four
      minutes and thirty-three seconds of silence. The accompanying notation is
      equally defiant, consisting of only the title and playing instructions to
      legitimize the blank page’s claim to be a composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toshi Ichiyanagi, a Japanese composer and student of Cage’s, would further
      the work of his mentor and contribute heavily to the emerging graphic
      notation movement of the 1950s. Graphic notation is defined by its
      variability and lack of standardization, used to indicate both extremely
      precise and intentionally imprecise musical instruction. It often
      incorporates elements of modern art into its visual appearance, and as
      such is often displayed as a visual piece removed from the music it
      indicates.

      composition would unknowingly foretell the future of music notation,
      correctly predicting the power of computers in revolutionizing the way
      music is stored, recorded and communicated.

      The 1990s saw the rise of audio-composition software, which found new ways
      to represent music notes while adapting to the technology of the time.
      MIDI (short for Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a communications
      protocol that allows electronic instruments to communicate data about
      musical instructions digitally. Decades prior, early electronic
      instruments popularized the MIDI format, and as audio-editing software
      rose in popularity, a new visual form was born to represent this
      futuristic notational form.

    <p>
      The visual representation of MIDI files varies between software, but tends
      to take the shape of a simple rectangle, only communicating the relative
      duration of the audio contained by the MIDI file. Despite their
      appearance, these rectangles contain an incredible amount of musical data,
      which is then accessed and modified using other parts of the software.
    </p>
    <p>
      MIDI files, and the popularization of visually-abstracted, data-driven
      audio, signals an end to one of standard notation's most foundational
      purposes. While notation is still used for physical performances, physical
      instruments are no longer necessary for the production of music- the data
      contained within MIDI files can be endlessly replicated, modified and
      reconstructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      MIDI files offer possibilities for music production that couldn’t have
      been fathomed even decades prior, which has naturally inspired composers
      to push the tool to its absolute limits. Black MIDI is a musical subgenre
      that involves packing as many MIDI notes into a single composition as
      possible, resulting in mesmerizing visuals only half as chaotic as the
      music they produce. Black refers to the hypothetical overlapping of music
      notes on a page, so crowded together they turn the page black.

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>

    <p>
      The history of music notation is an overlap of many separate histories;
      the history of music, technology, religion and, most notably, humanity
      itself. Notation establishes a structure to visually communicate the music
      being played, which in turn influences the creation of new music, and new
      ways of innovating beyond the limits of the existing structure. Ration and
      emotion, these two opposing ideals find common ground in the notation and
      performance of music, and push each other forward in an endless discovery
      of new possibilities for human expression.
